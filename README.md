# TwinCAT-Launcher

## Overview
I created this project to give people a sample of how you can automate the basic tasks we all have to go through in TwinCAT. I hope it leads on to some really clever and inventive uses of the Automation Interface.

## Requirements
TwinCAT 3 4024.0
.Net6
AutomationInterface-Engine nuget package is in the Packages folder.
This is actually generated form another project here: [Automation Interface Samples](https://github.com/chris-k84/Auto-Interface-TwinCAT-Basic).

## Instructions
Open the project and run the WPF app, you can enter a directory location to store the project and a TwinCAT project name. when done press the create button, the tool should then create a base TwinCAT project at the given location and open it ready for you to start.
